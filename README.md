# ML-Based-Coral-Water-Analysis-and-Optimization

This project uses machine learning to check if water is suitable for coral growth based on key factors like pH and temperature. It also helps improve unsuitable water data using ML techniques.

Project Highlights

Developed a machine learning model to classify water quality as suitable or unsuitable for coral growth.
Used clustering and regression techniques to adjust and improve unsuitable water data.
Supports coral reef conservation by using data to predict and optimize water quality.

Technologies Used

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

Future Improvements

Expansion of Dataset and Parameter Optimization.
Use real-time water data for live analysis.
Create a simple interface for users to check water suitability.
